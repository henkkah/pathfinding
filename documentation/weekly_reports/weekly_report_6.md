*Course:* Aineopintojen harjoitustyö: Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit (loppukesä 2021)  

## Working hours during the week
8.0 hours

## Done during the week
- Implemented performance comparison of algorithms to application
- Modified how app shows neighbors (now shows neighbors of neighbors as well)
- Improved visualization (axis removed, scaling of windows specified)
- Proper performance testing implemented
- Additional unittesting
- Finishing implementation documentation
- Finishing testing documentation

## How program has evolved?
- Comparison of algorithms implemented to app
- Showing neighbors in visualization improved, also other improvement in visualization
- New performance testing schema
- More unittesting

## What I learned during the week?
I learned more about visualization. I also learned more about performance testing.

## What remained unclear or created trouble?
Nothing particular this week :)

## What will I do next?
- Final modifications to app before final deadline
