# Weekly Report 5
*Author:* Henrik Harjula  
*Course:* Aineopintojen harjoitustyö: Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit (loppukesä 2021)  

## Working hours during the week
7.5 hours

## Done during the week
- Studied and coded IDA* algorithm
- O-analysis for IDA*
- Initial Performance testing
- Additional unittesting

## How program has evolved?
- IDA* algorithm coded
- Additional testing (performance and unit)

## What I learned during the week?
I learned what is IDA* algorithm and how to code it. I also learned how to do performance testing.

## What remained unclear or created trouble?
It remained a bit unclear for me whether I coded IDA* correctly, as I noted that it cannot find shortest paths with long distances. I assume this is because of design of the algorithm that it mainly works with short/mid distances.

## What will I do next?
- Do performance testing for app
- Widen testing
- Improve visualization
- Continue implementation and testing documents
