# Weekly Report 4
*Author:* Henrik Harjula  
*Course:* Aineopintojen harjoitustyö: Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit (loppukesä 2021)  

## Working hours during the week
7.5 hours

## Done during the week
- Min Heap implemented as self-coded data structure (instead of Python's standard heapq implementation)
- Min Heap tested and usage implemented to application
- Implementation documentation started
- O-analysis of Dijkstra's algorithm
- Testing documentation started

## How program has evolved?
- Min Heap implemented as self-coded data structure, tested, and implemented to application
- Adding clarifying commenting to code

## What I learned during the week?
I learned how to code Min Heap oneself. I also got some recap how to do O-analysis.

## What remained unclear or created trouble?
Performance testing is a new topic for me, and because of lack of time this week I will study it and implement it to my application next week.

## What will I do next?
- Study IDA* algorithm and code it
- Do performance testing for app
- Widen testing
- Improve visualization
- Continue implementation and testing documents
