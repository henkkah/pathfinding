# PathFinding App

Topic of this project is to make a pathfinding application.
Two pathfinding algorithms are used to compare their effectiveness (in terms of runtime) in finding the quickest path from one Finnish city to another Finnish city using Finnish highways (valtatie in Finnish).
Algorithms used are:
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*) algorithm
  
Also, speed limits of different highways are taken into account in calculating the quickest paths.
Purpose is to find the quickest path(s) (not necessarily shortest) when driving with car.
  
Application is used from command line – when a shortest path is queried, then a popup window visualizing resulting shortest path(s) is opened, including comparison of performance between the algorithms used.
  
Programming language of the project is Python.
  
This project is part of University of Helsinki's course 'Aineopintojen harjoitustyö: Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit' in August 2021.
